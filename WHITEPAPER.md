## Identity

**ProCo (Power Core)** is a small, transparent blockchain system built to understand how blockchains really work — not to compete with Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any commercial network.

ProCo exists as an **educational infrastructure**.

Its purpose is to allow students, researchers, and independent learners to:

- run real nodes
- inspect real blocks
- observe peer-to-peer networking
- study consensus behavior
- debug distributed systems

ProCo is a living classroom.

It is not a product.  
It is not a startup pitch.  
It is not a speculative asset.

---

## Mission

> To provide a transparent, reproducible blockchain system  
> that teaches distributed systems through direct hands-on experience.

Every design decision must support:

- clarity over complexity
- learning over performance hype
- transparency over abstraction
- reproducibility over marketing

If a feature does not improve understanding, it does not belong.

---

## Non-Negotiable Principles

### No Token Economics
ProCo will never issue speculative tokens, coins, or financial instruments.  
It is not a cryptocurrency project.

Education cannot depend on speculation.

---

### Full Transparency

- Source code is public
- Architecture decisions are documented
- Limitations are openly acknowledged
- Failures are recorded honestly

Trust is built through visibility, not promises.

---

### Educational First

Every change must answer:

> Does this make the system easier to understand?

If the answer is no, the change is rejected.

---

### No False Claims

ProCo will never claim to:

- replace existing blockchains
- outperform industrial systems
- solve global finance
- revolutionize markets

Accuracy protects longevity.

---

### Integrity Over Growth

- No expansion that risks collapse
- No roadmap built on illusion
- No promises that require deception

Slow, stable progress is preferred over explosive visibility.

---

## Relationship with Money

ProCo acknowledges a simple reality: infrastructure requires resources.

Funding is accepted only under these conditions:

- Support does not buy ownership
- Support does not control protocol direction
- Support does not compromise educational goals
- All funding usage remains transparent

Money is fuel.  
It is not authority.

---

## Relationship with Contributors

ProCo welcomes contributors aligned with its philosophy.

Participation includes:

- testing nodes
- debugging behavior
- improving documentation
- studying architecture
- contributing responsibly

ProCo cannot promise financial reward.

It offers:

- real technical experience
- open learning infrastructure
- collaborative engineering credibility

---

## Community Philosophy

ProCo seeks participants, not followers.

Authority comes from:

- clarity
- contribution
- technical honesty

Anyone may inspect, question, fork, challenge, or improve.

Constructive criticism is welcome.

---

## Survival Doctrine

ProCo grows only at a rate that can be sustained ethically.

The project will never:

- depend on hype cycles
- promise unrealistic expansion
- trade integrity for attention
- disguise instability as innovation

The goal is endurance.

A system that survives 20 years matters more than one that trends for 20 days.

---

## Invitation

ProCo invites observation, not blind belief.

If you value transparent education and honest engineering:

You are welcome.

If you want to test, run, inspect, or challenge the system:

You are welcome.

If you want to help keep the infrastructure alive:

You are welcome.

This project belongs to those who value truth over spectacle.

---

## Closing Statement

Knowledge should be:

- runnable
- visible
- testable
- shared

This project will move forward with or without attention,  
but never without integrity.
