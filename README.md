# ProCo (Power Core) Blockchain ⚡

ProCo (Power Core) is an experimental Layer-1 blockchain project focused on
simplicity, transparency, and learning-driven decentralization.

This project is built step-by-step to understand blockchain fundamentals deeply,
rather than rushing toward hype or shortcuts.
