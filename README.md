🚀 ProCo Blockchain (Power Core)

ProCo is an experimental, open-source blockchain project focused on simplicity, transparency, and learning-first design.
It is built from scratch to understand how blockchains work at their core — blocks, transactions, nodes, and consensus.

This project is in early development and is intended for:

Developers learning blockchain internals

Open-source contributors

Researchers exploring lightweight blockchain designs

🌟 Vision

Most blockchains are hard to understand and even harder to build from scratch.
ProCo aims to be simple, readable, and educational, while still being practical.

Our goal is to build a clean, modular blockchain core that anyone can study, modify, and extend.
