# ProCo (Power Core) Blockchain ⚡

ProCo (Power Core) is an experimental Layer-1 blockchain project focused on
simplicity, transparency, and learning-driven decentralization.

This project is built step-by-step to understand blockchain fundamentals deeply,
rather than rushing toward hype or shortcuts.

---

## 🌱 Vision

To build a clean, understandable blockchain core that can evolve into a
community-driven decentralized network.

ProCo prioritizes:
- Learning by building
- Transparency over hype
- Strong fundamentals before scale

---

## 🔧 Current Features

- Custom blockchain implementation
- Block creation and validation
- Fixed-supply native token
- Genesis block and chain persistence
- Multi-node setup (Node1 & Node2 synced)
- AWS-based deployment (early stage)

---

## 🧱 Architecture (High Level)

- Language: Go
- Consensus: Experimental / custom (early stage)
- Networking: Peer-to-peer (in progress)
- Storage: Local block persistence
- Tokenomics: Fixed supply (defined at genesis)

> ⚠️ This project is **not production-ready** and is intended for
> research, experimentation, and learning.
